## Titanic-Datamining-Analysis

This project is the datamining analysis on the RMS Titanic dataset.

The Titanic was a ship that attempted to sailed with passengers from Southampton, England to New York, USA. The RMS Titanic did not complete its voyage as it hit an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912. 

The following algoritms will be applied to the Titanic dataset. 

Classification Algorithms:
- Decision Tree Algorithm
- Na√Øve Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Logistic Regression
- SVM Classification
- Kernel SVM

Random Forest Classification
- Regression Algoritihms:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- SVM Regression
- Kernel SVM

In this exercise we will try to determine the following:

Which of the classification models and regression models used performed the best in predicting the probability of survival or non-survival from the Titanic?

Did any one or more features play a contributing factor in the probability of survival?
